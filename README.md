# word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors

This repository hosts the `word2vec` pre-trained **Google News** corpus word vector model (English word vectors). 

It is mirroring the data from the official (word2vec website)[https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/]:
(GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing]

The motivation was to provide an easy (programmatical) way to download the model file, ie. via `git clone` instead of accessing the Google Drive link.

You need to install (git lfs)[https://git-lfs.github.com/] to be able to clone this.
